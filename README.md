# Capstone-Project4-Udacity-Data-Scientist
As part of the udacity.com Data Scientist nanodegree, this is project four and the final project of the program. This project involves Convolutional Neural Networks, including a web application that allows the user to upload an image of a dog or a human, and I will showcase an AI that will output the closest dog breed resemblance to the image.
